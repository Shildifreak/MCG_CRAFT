# Description #

The files in this directory are meant to help with running MCGCraft as a service on a linux server.
When installed successfully, this will make MCGCraft start automatically when someone tries to connect.
You may want to familiarize yourself with systemd using the links provided at the end.


# Installation #

Create directories and copy the scripts into the correct locations:
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin/
cp mcgcraft mcgcraft-server -t ~/.local/bin/
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/
cp mcgcraft.service mcgcraft.socket -t ~/.config/systemd/user/
Make scripts executable:
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/mcgcraft ~/.local/bin/mcgcraft-server

Reload systemd configuration and enable the service
$ systemctl --user daemon-reload
$ systemctl --user enable mcgcraft.socket

To keep the server active even if you are not logged in enable lingering
$ loginctl enable-linger


# Usage #

To interact with the MCGCraft server shell use
$ mcgcraft-server
Logs can be inspected in the journal
$ journalctl --user -u mcgcraft


# Issues #

Journalctl may tell you that you are not allowed to read logs.
Access Control for journalctl --user only works with persistent logs.
[Get your admin to] change the Storage directive of the [Journal] section 
of /etc/systemd/journald.conf to persistent (instead of auto or volatile). 
Reboot after editing the configuration file.
Alternatively you can manually create and activate the journal directory:
$ mkdir /var/log/journal
$ systemd-tmpfiles --create
$ journalctl --flush

The scripts we provide here were tested with systemd version 241.
