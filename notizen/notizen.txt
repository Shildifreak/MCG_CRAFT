	opendiff kdiff3 tkdiff xxdiff meld tortoisemerge gvimdiff diffuse diffmerge ecmerge p4merge araxis bc codecompare emerge vimdiff
	Größe der Spielfigur als Breite, Höhe, etc. anstelle von Eckpunkten
	collide(character,blockpos) funktion die sagt ob Spielfigur mit Stelle kollidiert -> beim Block platzieren benutzen
	Missing Texture so machen, dass man die Rotation trotzdem sehen kann
	solid spalte entfernen und als Blockeigenschaft definieren
	Listen die abschließende doppelte enthalten streichen.

Plan:
	Blöcke Items droppen lassen (wenn nötig Entities optimieren mit callback von chunks(for changed blocks on their path ... so the ground they are lying upon))
	Aufsammeln von Blöcken ermöglichen
	HUD
	Inventar anzeigen
	Auswahl von Blöcken aus Inventar ermöglichen
	Speichern fixen

BLOCKS
	DATA
		mcgcraft:name {}
		mcgcraft:chest {content:[{},{}]}
		mcgcraft:redstone {powered:0b}
		mcgcraft:furnace {rotation:4,lit:1,content:[],...}
	MINING
		when blocks are mined they get a link who mined them and what they were mined with, so they can drop the right item:
			mcgcraft:player{Shildifreak}, mcgcraft:air{}                           -> mined by hand
			mcgcraft:player{Shildifreak}, mcgcraft:iron_pickaxe{}                  -> mined by iron pickaxe
			mcgcraft:player{Shildifreak}, mcgcraft:iron_pickaxe{echantments:[...]} -> mined by enchanted iron pickaxe
			mcgcraft:creeper{0x00},       None                                     -> blown up by creeper
			mcgcraft:block_collision{},   None                                     -> mined by piston
			mcgcraft:tnt{},               None                                     -> mined by tnt

noshift		break block		activate block
shift		left hand item	right hand item

ITEMS
	INVENTORY
		open inventory with e -> infinitely big? -> scrolling through possible, first n are hotbar
		empty slots possible
		designated hands wich is(/are) not really part of the inventory
		clicking item swaps whatever is in hand with the item
		counts on them that are ignored in creative
	STORAGE
		just drop items on ground
		click on them to pick them up
		special block that prevents dropped items on top from despawning ("chest")
	TRADING
		there has to be a key for dropping items
	CRAFTING
		???
PVP

REDSTONE
	WIRING
		blocks that act like redstone in real minecraft, but can be pushed around, (stand on?), etc.
	PISTONS
		force in x y z -> sum of forces from around rounded to -1,0,1
		if airblock: become block that gets pushed in

		dont have real extension
		push blocks (and items?) in front of them (up to 12) on rising edge
		pull block in front of them on falling edge (all pistons are sticky?, but since they have no extension part it doesn't matter)
	SOME FORM OF BLOCK ABLE OF CLICKING
		can activate everything that players can do (break blocks, set blocks, change lever state)
INTERNAL
	STRICT CELLULAR AUTOMATA: ALL BLOCKS ONLY DEPEND ON THEIR (26) NEIGHBOURCELLS, THEMSELFES, AND RANDOM
	block updates
	setblocks are buffered so that all blocks see other blocks states from last tick so update order doesn't matter
	if two setblocks are scheduled for the same block then the one with a lower mining level/blast resistance is "mined" so it drops as an item or something similar
	when blocks are mined by pistons, explosions, endermen,... that counts as a special "mining kind"
	blocks can have special right click action
	Blocks that dont have full Hitbox (like torches) can be combined as long as their hitboxes dont collide






grass
	block_update
		see if powered, update powered state
	random tick
		if block above turn to dirt
	mined
		drop grass block item at current position
	right_clicked
		pass
	left_clicked
		pass
