We intend publish one release per year, during the summer holidays.

When creating a new Release make sure to do the following steps:

- create new branch named release_20XX (where 20XX is the current year)

- set version number

- adjust webclient link to fixed version

- add executables for linux and windows

- commit

- check out using git clone --depth=1 ...
  -> zip
  (so we can provide a zip without history but still support for automated update)

- tag the release as release_20XX.0.0
  -> add zip file from previous step

Only add nonbreaking bugfixes on this branch if necessary
