AG 2022 Pläne und Ideen
	Wie erstellt/bearbeitet man Texturen?
	Schaftextur "verbessern"?
	give command
	nicht auf wasser laufen
	Inventar verbessern
	Crafting einführen
	weniger buggy laden (größere chunks)
	(((Shader)))

Zu sichten und sortieren:
	
	bug:
		items fail to render some block models on desktop client
		items kill performance when bouncing is enabled (feels like a problem with message buffer)
		client_utils.py: select is not defined
		webclient scroll does not work in inventory (or generally when not in exclusive mode), neither esc nor e do work to close inventory
		webdemo does not work from school -> probably a firewall issue -> detect better to at least show useful error message -> but it did show some messages going through websocket, so where exactly is the error?
		entities without texture are still sent to client (consider the case where a texture is changed to be None but was visible before!)
	
	todo:
		add portal
	
		display emotes on hud too
	
		in sethud command have a seperate clickable argument instead of using # in id
		-> maybe also draggable and at this point we may combine that into a flags int (add align argument there too)
		remove password from control command, add authentication command instead -> so players can have priviledges independent of controlled entities
		
		move settings menu from index.html and terraintest/index.html into script used by both
	
		fix glitches when adjusting bounds of world buffer
			-> separate render distance from raytracing steps?
			-> lower and upper bounds that exclude currently loading chunks?
			-> bitmap containing info about which chunks are currently loading / already valid?
			-> immediately zero fill reused buffer areas?
	
		add F11 for fullscreen to desktop client
		remove unimplemented code stuff on desktop client
			has_blocks_to_be_updated, get_block_to_be_updated

		optimizing set command in MessageBuffer
			replace del by set None/null

			group set commands by block

			if only a few or spaced wide apart
			-> set block <x y z>*
			
			alternatively use
			-> setarea block x y z dx dy dz bitmap
			(maybe wait if still growing to group even more?)

			use goto location to inform order of block and entity messages

		Änderung der serverinfo in gui (zB. Speicherort) sollte reload triggern!

		add ability to scroll foreign inventory with mousewheel/scroll keys?
		-> have to send focused hud element with scroll
	
		desktop client: make only one vertex list per entity model (or reuse them?)

		print("Consider setting a password when using a name.") -> move this to gui or server?
	
	Survival Progression
		-> add survival mode gamesetting
		Sticks -> from Leaves (no tool)
		Stone -> from naturally generated Cobblestone
		String -> Vines? Grass? Flux? Spiderwebs?
		Stone Tools -> Sticks + Stones + String/Glue
		Wood -> Tree + Stone Axe
	
	Block Processor
		-> Block that can output or input redstone Signals on all 6 sides. Programmable via C/Lua/Python o.ä.
		Have a way to create this block that can be automated and the better (faster?) you do it the better the block becomes (freq, mem, etc.)
	Peristaltik Item Container
		-> contract when provided with a redstone signal
		   forcing items to spill into neighbouring containers with free slots or into the world
		-> make work with signal blocks
	Signal Block
		-> redstone signal will trigger a spike followed by a regeneration period before it can trigger again
	
	scoreboard for crashing demo server: name -> no. crashes (count when online and active just before crash)
	make it possible to select as which entity to spawn -> default to Mensch obviously, but also allow Sheep, etc.
		-> spawn command? -> instead of just control command

	blockbench 3D pixel modeling software
	PHP für mcgcraft website header
	option to upload resource packs for terraintest

	tolerance setting for misbehaving clients: drop immediately / allow N malformed messages per time
	inheritable permissions for players and command blocks
		-> revoking rights from player also removes them from his command blocks and whomever he gave rights to
	make player visible but invincible when logged off?
	Icon/Thumbnail for Servers
	use ternary encoding as base for chunk tree structure -> there is a center which means, no quadrants to think about
		http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/ternary/bct.shtml
	fix up and down arrows in MCGCraft
	visual indicators for hands in inventory
	autoclose inventory after item selection?
	hold e to open inventory?
	rethink hotbar -> links only? no hotbar? / ...? (find out if anyone is actually using it and how)
	global setting for custom config path (.\config / H:\ / ~ ...)
	make chest drop items when broken
	implement remote server config script
	turn all worlds into js, deprecate python worlds -> warn if setup places large amount of blocks
	activate always prefered when not shifting? need air or tool to break stuff?
	number keys to activate items directly from hotbar?
	rethink scrolling
	make better plugin stuff for Air and SolidBlock etc.
	find a way to stitch pngs without need for pygame
		-> first outsource into (sub)module of tpmanager
	block.save(event=BLOCKUPDATE)
		-> or for event handler, return BLOCKUPDATE instead of True
	tags dokumentieren: zB. solid marks blocks that implement a collide method that sometimes or always returns True
	check out https://github.com/segonzal/pyVoxel
	[item] entangler
	use KNF/DNF for tags filtering
	intersection and union of tags needed for that
	create new BlockWorld that uses SQL database
	mariaDB spatialindex/rtree
	discard out of time entity movements instead of trying to keep up
	test if require works in world file
	add nether portal
	lagesensoren zur Steuerung von MCGCraft auf mobilen geräten
	Normal-/Reflektionmap, fogcolor
	graphic settings menu (at least renderdistance, world buffer size would be great too)
	read block skipping

	Pressure Blocks
		compression: only for air, increases/decreases when multiple air blocks are combined into one space 
		pressure: pushing forces per face
		drag: spreading force to neighbouring blocks, mostly for groups of blocks of same type
		crosstalk: how much x, y, z axes influence each other (like air totally spreads out in all directions, whereas stone will only propagate force along the axis it came from
		blocks can only ever go to where there is air with zero compression (vacuum)
		Druckdifferenz -> Flowrate
		Volume -> Pressure
		Pressure -> Force
		Force -> Movement
		can count area / accumulate forces by constructing tree and passing values up and down

	talk / philosophy
		Minecraft eignet sich weil die Grundlegenden Spielmechaniken sehr einfach sind und es viel Freiheit gibt für neue Spielelemente gibt, aber klare Vorstellungen wie diese mit bereits existierenden Elementen interagieren
		-> MCGCraft wird nie so performant sein wie das original Minecraft oder andere Clones (wie ... oder ...). Priorität ist, dass anhand einer soliden Implementierung eine Dokumentation (/Anleitung) aufgebaut wird die auf einfachem Level die Grundbestandteile eines Spiels beschreibt und auf Prinzipien wie Events, Zelluläre Automaten, Client-Server-Modell, etc. eingeht.
		Intended game mechanics intended consequences, unintended consequences, valid states of the game, bugs, consequences of bugs
			-> Consequences not all beeing known is part of the fun, but game should remain in a valid state
		Concepts: 3D Cellular Automata, Raytracing on voxels, ...
			strict cellular automata: all blocks only depend on their (26) neighbourcells, themselfes, and random

	mcgcraft online
		Platform that can configure/close/open server and pull source code from github -> paying for having server there, paying more for server that doesn't put adds on client?
		increase number of workers
		add ask if really want to exit page for editor
		checken welche Browser funktionieren und entsprechend Hinweise geben
		MCGCraft Online eine hübschere Seite verpassen
		FOV
		GUI Area Limiting
		linear vs circular view angle interpolation
		ScreenOrientation.onchange - Web APIs | MDN

		unify reflections of all fragments of pixel to keep pixely look?
