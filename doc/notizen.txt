Dinge die man in der AG machen könnte:
	Schafe:
		ändern Textur wenn angeklickt und geben Wolle -> wächst nach wenn sie Gras fressen
		suchen nach Grasblöcken in der Umgebung 
		verschiedene AIs / Persönlichkeiten -> faul, quirlig, verfressen, anhänglich, ängstlich, ...

	dna für Bäume -> ermöglicht züchten

Bugs:
	tnt crashes client
	entities werden nicht ordentlich entfernt wenn server gestoppt wird
	Zwei Fackeln nebeneinander freezen das Spiel, Update kann gepowerte Fackel wieder ausmachen :(

Verbesserungskram:
	

Plan:
	Blöcke Items droppen lassen (wenn nötig Entities optimieren mit callback von chunks(for changed blocks on their path ... so the ground they are lying upon))
		-> Block-Entity-Updates -> called to entities in same chunk as changed block
	Aufsammeln von Blöcken ermöglichen
	Entities walking up halfslabs, stairs, etc. without jumping

		mcgcraft:chest {content:[{},{}]}
		mcgcraft:redstone {powered:0b}
		mcgcraft:furnace {rotation:4,lit:1,content:[],...}
	MINING
		when blocks are mined they get a link who mined them and what they were mined with, so they can drop the right item:
			mcgcraft:player{Shildifreak}, mcgcraft:air{}                           -> mined by hand
			mcgcraft:player{Shildifreak}, mcgcraft:iron_pickaxe{}                  -> mined by iron pickaxe
			mcgcraft:player{Shildifreak}, mcgcraft:iron_pickaxe{echantments:[...]} -> mined by enchanted iron pickaxe
			mcgcraft:creeper{0x00},       None                                     -> blown up by creeper
			mcgcraft:block_collision{},   None                                     -> mined by piston
			mcgcraft:tnt{},               None                                     -> mined by tnt

noshift		break block		activate block
shift		left hand item	right hand item

ITEMS
	INVENTORY
		open inventory with e
		infinitely big, if you have no place in inventory but break a block your inventory grows
		scrolling through possible, first 7 are hotbar
		slots are made available for user by putting air in them
		designated hands wich are not really part of the inventory
		left/right clicking item swaps whatever is in corresponding hand with the item
		counts on them that are ignored in creative
	STORAGE
		blocks can have inventory -> for instance chest
	TRADING
		use chests for now since there are no dropped items
	CRAFTING
		???
PVP

REDSTONE
	WIRING
		blocks that act like redstone in real minecraft, but can be pushed around, (stand on?), etc.
	PISTONS
		force in x y z -> sum of forces from around rounded to -1,0,1
		if airblock: become block that gets pushed in

		dont have real extension
		push blocks (and items?) in front of them (up to 12) on rising edge
		pull block in front of them on falling edge (all pistons are sticky?, but since they have no extension part it doesn't matter)
	SOME FORM OF BLOCK ABLE OF CLICKING
		can activate everything that players can do (break blocks, set blocks, change lever state)
INTERNAL
	STRICT CELLULAR AUTOMATA: ALL BLOCKS ONLY DEPEND ON THEIR (26) NEIGHBOURCELLS, THEMSELFES, AND RANDOM
	block updates
	setblocks are buffered so that all blocks see other blocks states from last tick so update order doesn't matter
	if two setblocks are scheduled for the same block then the one with a lower mining level/blast resistance is "mined" so it drops as an item or something similar
	when blocks are mined by pistons, explosions, endermen,... that counts as a special "mining kind"
	blocks can have special right click action
	Blocks that dont have full Hitbox (like torches) can be combined as long as their hitboxes dont collide
